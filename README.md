# Weather App
This is a simple, responsive weather forecast app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was developed as part of the SheCodes workshop series to practice working with APIs, JavaScript DOM manipulation, React, and layout design. The app fetches and displays current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any city entered by the user.
